# Programming in English

Programming in English aims to debunk the idea that programming can only be done by highly qualified professionals. This notion is heavily promoted by the software industry, but in spite of massive computer power and the arrival of ever more sophisticated programming tools and frameworks, well over half of all software projects continue to be delivered late, over budget and not meeting the expectations of their users. The main reason for this is that those who understand the problem space - its users - are unable to contribute to or oversee the software development process, which is left in the hands of those who understand the technology but not the real world.

This repository is a book that describes how to build a versatile computer language whose scripts look like a series of step-by-step English commands with a syntax similar to cookery recipes, navigation instructions or car maintenance manuals. The syntax will be English stripped to the minimum; terse but understandable by anyone familiar with the problem domain. The environment will be that of a web browser and the language will be a comprehensive, capable and easy to use replacement for JavaScript, permitting scripts to be embedded in any web page then compiled and run on the fly as the page loads.
