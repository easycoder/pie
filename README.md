# Programming in English

This repository is a book that describes how to build a versatile computer language whose scripts look like a series of step-by-step English commands with a syntax similar to cookery recipes, navigation instructions or car maintenance manuals. The syntax will be English stripped to the minimum; terse but understandable by anyone familiar with the problem domain. The environment will be that of a web browser and the language will be a comprehensive, capable and easy to use replacement for JavaScript, permitting scripts to be embedded in any web page then compiled and run on the fly as the page loads.
